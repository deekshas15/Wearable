# Description: 
Impact project has on the society:
Due to the increasing cases of COVID-19, social distancing has become a very important aspect in todayâ€™s day to day life. According to governments Guidelines: Social distancing is a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control intervention implemented to avoid/decrease contact between those who are infected with a disease-causing pathogen and those who are not, so as to stop or slow down the rate and extent of disease transmission in a community
In order to follow such guidelines, we have come up with an innovative project that would help us maintain a safe distance between people if they have to step out of their safe environments.
# challenges faced:
One challenge was to make sure the device itself stays as stable as possible while making sure, that carrying the device is not a tedious task
For this we came up with the solution that instead of making the device as some kind of hand/ankle bracelet, we should make it in the form of a belt. This would provide a good stability on the body. Plus, this would also make the carrying of the device easier.
# system design implementation:
We have made a device that is compact and easy to carry around. This includes a PIR motion sensor, which detects a moving object in front of it. An ultrasonic sensor which detects an object within a specified range. If we use both of these sensors together, then we can effectively detect when a person comes in close contact with us (less than 7 feet). The sound of a buzzer and a blinking LED will alert the person wearing the device of the same. Additionally, we have included a temperature sensor so that the person can keep a check on their own temperature at all times.
